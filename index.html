            <p>Have you ever wanted to create and host your own website? Starting from scratch can be confusing even when you already know a little HTML and CSS. Lot of companies can help create complex blogs and shopping sites, but sometimes you just need something simple.</p>
            <p>There’s an easier way to create website at a fraction of the cost – a static webpage. This tutorial explains how you can create your own webpage with a few lines in a text editor, then will show you two cost-effective ways to hosting this content. You'll get a high-level view of how content is delivered over the internet, and a great way to host your own portfolio, personal site or (almost) anything you can imagine.</p>

                    <p>Most websites on the internet live on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)" target="_blank">server</a> – a fancy word for a computer accessible from the public internet. But there’s another kind of website – a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page" target="_blank">static website</a> – that is much more basic. </p>
                    <p>Static websites don’t need to be run (or hosted) on servers like traditional websites. The code for these websites runs completely in your browser. Since they don’t talk to databases, they can be stored in something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage" target="_blank">object (or <i>blob</i>) storage</a>.</p>
                    <p>Internet users can access static sites more quickly then server based sites. Plus, not needing a server makes them significantly cheaper.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <p>Static websites can’t communicate directly with a database over a server, but they can do almost anything else. Then can still retrieve and send data by sending requests to an <a href="https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/", target="_blank">Application Programming Interface (API)</a> and play an important role in  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/serverless-computing/" target="_blank">serverless computing</a>. In fact these days, most browsers are so powerful there isn’t a lot they can’t do.</p>
                <p>Static websites also offer many benefits that include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Low cost:</i> static websites are significantly cheaper than server-based websites, even one hosted by CMSs like WordPress</li>
                    <li><i>High scaling:</i> static websites are so simple they scale effortlessly even at high volumes of traffic</li>
                    <li><i>Easy deployments:</i> anyone who can create a basic HTML document can deploy one in a few minutes</li>

                <p>When you visit a webpage, you're really visiting a file (or group of files) stored on a different computer. Special software on the server makes that file findable by people browsing on the internet.  These files contain everything needed to display the page – text, styles, images and code to load other resources.</p>
                <p>The one file every webpage must have is an .html file. This is a standard filetype, like .doc or .jpg. When your browser (like Chrome, Firefox or Edge) recieves a .html file over the internet, it translates the code in the .html file (and all it's linked files) into the text, styling and actions you see on your screen.</p>
                <p>Web developers use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/popular-ides-and-code-editors/" target="_blank">special programs</a> to create and editor their code – but HTML files are just text documents. They can be created in any text editor, but some add additional formatting that can interfere with the code. Simpler text editors are usually better.</p>

                <p>Now let's add a feature called GitHub Actions, which will to deploy your site automatically every time you change the code in this repository.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the <b>Settings</b> tab on top of the repository</li>
                    <li>Select <b>Pages</b> from the navigation bar on the right</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Build and Deployment</b> heading, make sure <b>Source</b> is set to <b>GitHub Actions</b></li>
                    <li>In the <b>Static HTML</b> panel that appears, click <b>Configure</b></li>
                    <li>Some code will appear, but you don’t need to make any changes. Just click <b>Commit Changes</b> on this screen and the next dialog that appears</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Put very simply: the Cloud is a huge number of tightly-networked computers (servers) all around the world. This network lets us share content fast worldwide, process data more efficiently and instantly deploy new resources. Since computing resources are shared, it can also mean big cost saving for certain projects. </p>
                <p>There are several different Clouds (like <a href="cloud.google.com" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> and <a href="azure.microsoft.com">Microsoft Azure</a>) which all offer similar functionality. I’m using Amazon Web Services (AWS) in this tutorial since it's the simplest for beginners, but similar concepts should apply to any Cloud Provider.</p>
                <p>All Cloud Providers work on a “pay-as-you-go” model, meaning you will only pay for resources you actually use. It also means you need to be careful to watching you're spending – we'll learn an easy way to do this on AWS in a later section.</p>

                </ol>
                <p>Your bucket is now configured and ready to host your website!

                <p>You probably noticed the name for your website is a little hard to remember. That’s because S3 generate this name automatically by combining the name of the bucket with the region it was created in.</p>
                <p>Everything on the internet, including your website, is identifiable by a string of unique numbers called an Internet Protocol (IP Address). IP Addresses make sending things to the right device possible – but they aren’t particularly easy to remember or use, however.</p>
                <p>Browsers let us find websites using their Domain Name – something like amazon.com, mit.edu or whitehouse.gov. The <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" target="_blank"> Domain Name System (DNS)</a> uses special servers called Nameservers to <i>resolve</i> Domain Names to their IP addresses and direct traffic to the correct site.  </p>
                <p>There are only so many of these names available for a given <i>domain</i> (the last part of the domain name after the period, like .com and .edu). There are only so many of these names available and you need permission to use certain domains. An organization called <a href="www.icann.org">ICANN</a> manages the ownership and expiration of Domain Names, but you don’t buy names through them directly. Instead, Domain Names are purchased through a registration service.</p>
