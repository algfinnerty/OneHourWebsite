            <p>Have you ever wanted to create and host your own website? Starting from scratch can be time consuming and hard to learn, even if you already know a little HTML and CSS. A lot of companies can help you create complex blogs and shopping sites, but these can be expensive if you only need to display simple content.</p>
            <p>There’s an easy way to create a professional looking website – a static webpage. This tutorial will introduce the concept of a static site, show you two cost-effective ways of hosting that content and show you a high-level view of how content is delivered over the internet.</p>

                    <p>Most websites you visit live on a server, a fancy word for a computer accessible from the public internet. But there’s another kind of website – a static website – that is much more basic. </p>
                    <p>Static websites don’t need to be run (or hosted) on servers like traditional websites. All their code runs in the browser. Since they don’t talk to databases, they can be stored in what is called object storage. People can access these sites whenever they are needed and don’t always need to be running, which makes them significantly cheaper than hosting a website on a server.</p>

                <p>Static websites can’t communicate directly with a database but can retrieve and send data over API calls. In fact these days, most browsers are so powerful there isn’t a lot they can’t do. They also offer many benefits that include:</p>

                    <li><i>Low cost:</i> static websites are significantly cheaper than server-based websites, even one hosted by CMSs like WordPress</li>

                    <li><i>Easy deployments:</i> anyone who can create a basic HTML document can deploy one in a few minutes</li>

                <p>When you visit a webpage, you are really visiting a file (or group of files) that’s stored on a different computer. Special software called a server makes that file available to the public. These files contain everything needed to display the page – text, styles, images and code to load other resources.</p>
                <p>When your browser (like Chrome, Firefox or Edge) displays a web page, it translates these files to show you the text, styling and actions embedded in that code.</p>
                <p>Web developers use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/popular-ides-and-code-editors/" target="_blank">special programs</a> to create and editor their code, but HTML files are just text documents. They can be created in any text editor, but some add additional formatting that can interfere with the code. Simpler text editors are usually better.</p>

                <p>You can think of tags like a container that enclosing everything ‘inside’ the tag with a specific meaning or style. The only things that can go inside the &lt;html>&lt;/html> tags are plain text or other HTML tags – but you have plenty of tags to choose from.</p>

                    <li><i>Semantic Tags</i> like &lt;main>&lt;/main>, &lt;section>&lt;/section>, heading and list tags. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">Semantic tags</a> come with additional built-in features and are important landmarks for people using accessibility devices.</li>
                    <li><i>Non-semantic Tags </i> like &lt;div> and &lt;span> do not carry additional meaning and are good for stylistic elements and containers</li>

                <p>All browsers have default (or fallback) styles they use to display a webpage when no specific styles are provided. If you’re looking for more impact, you can add (almost) any style you imagine to HTML elements. Styles can be <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp" target="_blank">added directly to elements</a>, but more often they will be added by writing another language called CSS inside a pair of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/tag_style.asp" target="_blank">&lt;style>&lt;/style> tags</a> or through a seperate .css file linked in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_howto.asp" target="_blank">&lt;head>&lt;/head></a>.</p>

                <p>Basic CSS is easy to read. Styles applied to the body tag affect the entire document. The styles applied to the &lt;h1> tag and the &lt;p> tag in the example above will be applied to all uses of those tags. If you need to be more specific, you can explore adding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Type_Class_and_ID_Selectors" target="_blank">classes and ids</a> to elements.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <p>Put simply, the Cloud is a bunch of different computers around the world that work together to perform the same tasks. This lets us share content faster, process data more efficiently, and save costs by sharing computing resources. </p>
                <p>There are several different Clouds which all offer a similar functionality. I’ve chosen to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) in this tutorial. Similar concepts should apply to any Cloud Provider.</p>
                <p>The Cloud can have many benefits, but for simple websites the main value is cost savings. All Cloud Providers work on a “pay-as-you-go” model, meaning you will only pay for resources you actually use.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <p>AWS provides many services free to new users for the <a href="aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">first twelve months</a>. You will be charged for each service separately, so it’s important to check the billing page for each service you are using. AWS provides a <a href="https://calculator.aws" target="_blank">calculator</a> that can be helpful to get a rough idea of the costs of using multiple services together.</p>
                <p><b>Simple Storage Service (S3)</b> is the name of the service you’ll use to hose your static site. Here the project estimate for the cost of hosting a 1GB Website in S3 with 20,000 visits a month:</p>

                <p>Signing up for an AWS Account is a little more complex than GitHub and requires credit card information. Be careful – if you go over the limits of the Free Tier, AWS will charge you automatically.</p>

                    <li>Go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">AWS Free Tier</a> and click on the yellow <b>Create a Free Account</b> button in the center of the page.</li>
                    <li>On the next page, enter your email address and the name you’d like to use for your account. </li>

                <p>It’s always a good idea to set up alerts for your AWS account in case you get an unexpected surge in traffic or experiment with a service and forget to turn it off.

                <p>First, we'll create an S3 Bucket to hold your website.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Search for S3 in the main search bar on the top of the page</li>

                    <li>On the next page, give your bucket a globally unique name. Think carefully – if you don’t buy a domain name, this is the name people will use to access the site.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Block Public Access Settings</b> uncheck the box marked <b>All Public Access.</b>

            <section>
                <p>Now that you’ve created a public S3 Bucket, there are just a few more steps to configure it for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html?icmpid=docs_amazons3_console" target="_blank"></a> web hosting.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>On the <b>S3 dashboard</b>, select the Bucket you just created.</li>
                    <li>Click the <b>Properties</b> tab at the top of the page, then scroll to the section called ‘Static website hosting’</li>    
                    <li>Click the grey <b>edit</b> button on the right of the <b>Static website hosting’ section</b></li> 
                    <li>On the page that opens, click <b>enable</b> then fill in the name of your <i>Index document</i> (your home or default page). This is easy because we called it index.html!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Your bucket is now configured and ready to host your website! If you check the <b>Static website hosting</b> box again, you will see the updated information, including the default URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for your new site. If you visit it right now, you’ll get an error message -- the last step is adding your index.html file to the bucket.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Click back to the <b>Objects</b> tab and click the orange <b>Upload</b> on the bucket to the right</li>

            <section class="info-section">
                <p>You probably noticed the name for your website is a little hard to remember. That’s because S3 generate this name automatically by combining the name of the bucket with the region it was created in.</p>
                <p>Everything on the internet, including your website, is identifiable by a string of unique numbers called an Internet Protocol (IP Address). IP Addresses make sending things to the right device possible -- but they aren’t particularly easy to remember or use, however.</p>
                <p>Browsers let us find websites using their Domain Name -- something like amazon.com, mit.edu or whitehouse.gov. The <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" target="_blank"> Domain Name System (DNS)</a> uses special servers called Nameservers to <i>resolve</i> Domain Names to their IP addresses and direct traffic to the correct site.  </p>
                <p>There are only so many of these names available for a given <i>domain</i> (the last part of the domain name after the period, like .com and .edu). There are only so many of these names available and you need permission to use certain domains. An organization called <a href="www.icann.org">ICANN</a> manages the ownership and expiration of Domain Names, but you don’t buy names through them directly. Instead, Domain Names are purchased through a registration service.</p>

            <h4>Buy a custom domain name on Route 53<button class="invisible-button section-close-button"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></button></h4>
            <section>
                <p>There are many different domain registration services, but AWS also has its own service called Route 53. Route 53 lets you browse and buy new domain names, as well as configure domains names from different services. </p>    
                <ol>
                    <li>Search for Route 53 on the search bar on the top of the page</li>

                    <li>Search for a domain name. The results will show you a lot of options with different prices and different domains -- if you find one you like, AWS can charge it automatically to the credit card you have on file.</li>

                <p>When you registered your domain, Route 53 automatically created a Hosted Zone. A Hosted Zone contains a series of instructions called Records which contain instructions on how to route traffic to your Domain Name.

                <ol>
                    <li>On the Route 53 Dashboard, select <b>Hosted Zones</b> from the sidebar on the left</li>

                    <li>Click <b>Define simple record</b></li>
                    <li>On the next screen, leave the subdomain value blank and make sure the record type is set to <b>A – Routes Traffic to an IPv4 Address and some AWS Resources</b>
                        <img src="img/route53_simple_route.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>In the dropdown menu under <b>Value/Route traffic to</b> select <b>Alias to S3 Website Endpoint</b></li>
                    <li>Select the region where you created your S3 Bucket, then the URL for your website from the dropdowns below</li>
                    <li>Click <b>Create record</b>. If you go back and look at your hosted zone, you should see that Route 53 has created two new records (NS and SOA records) automatically.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Be patient! It may take some time before your new Domain Name routes correctly to your site. These changes need to be made (or propagated) on many different name servers all over the world which can sometimes take <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/troubleshooting-new-dns-settings-not-in-effect.html" target="_blank">several hours</a>.</p>
